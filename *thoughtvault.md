# \*thoughtvault
This is a log of my logging process. It explores, in a narrative format, all the different systems I have developed and used to jot down my thoughts.

## ⚙️ $J_1$: Conception
My system began with a trusty journal, wherein I stored any and all thoughts, chaotically, without any sense of organisation. When I started it, I was weary of losing the habit, as I have done before, so I implemented the following law:

---

> `LAW OF LOGGING (lol): YOU CAN LOG IF AND ONLY IF LOGGING BRINGS YOU JOY.`

---

I firmly believe cultivating this love for your work to be the foundational step for development in any art.

### Data structures: Storage and Retrieval
It soon became apparent that retrieval of any piece of information was inefficient. I experimented with

1. Grouping areas of focus, and indexing every page wherein it was mentioned
2. Flagging related content with washi tape or page markers
3. Limiting the kinds of information that I take notes on. For instance...
   - Not taking notes during conversations, as those notes were often taken hastily and the treasures proved useless upon re-examination.
   - Not taking notes on uni information in the journal, as the information was not easily retrievable, nor easily digestible in the pure chaotic form I was taking notes in.

## ⚙️ $J_2$: Abstraction and Diagrammatic Thinking
Concurrently, I found the concept of diagrammatic thinking (exploring ideas via diagrams and drawings rather than written words) fascinating. This was mainly because I was trying to fit the 'chaotic scholar' aesthetic, with runes all over their pages. I fantasized a visual language that would look aesthetically pleasing while also being fast to interpret for me. This naturally lead me to the concept of abstraction: each idea can be 'stored' written in bubbles, connected to other bubbles via certain pre-defined link symbols (!, &&, ||)... and... get this... _any 'bundle' of thought can be outlined and defined using a new symbol_. You can then use that symbol whenever you want to discuss the same idea again, almost like a function, implementing abstraction.

This.... didn't work. I didn't store these symbols well, and I didn't use the function feature often enough, which effectively made this an overexplained mind map. What's worse, the lack of structure in the journals was exacerbated with this method, since even the pages couldn't agree on what the most important piece of information is. Everything was same-y. Nothing could be realised at a glance. I felt myself mentally checking out whenever I tried to reread these pages.

## ⚙️ $J_3$: The Workflow of Reflection Cycles
Until $J_2$ (the second journal), I would only reflect on my journalling process once the journal had come to an end, which was once per roughly 3-4 months. I would only read my jibbersih when I felt like it. A friend of mine helped me come to realise the importance of working in cycles, demonstrated by her own bullet journal. I implemented a monthly view that span two pages, and sanctified washi tape to the responsibility of marking these pages throughout the journal. Every month, I would reflect on the previous month, consider ways of improving my system, highlight certain experiences and learnings, and generally make fun of my old idiotic self.

## ⚙️ $J_4$: Unstructured Data and Multisystematism
Some notes were extremely unstructured, or required a non-linear notetaking schema. I had experimented with Obsidian and Zettlekasten before, but found them... eh. So I decided to keep it simple and focus on the LAW OF LOGGING.

Previously, I had always written notes down on A5 pieces of paper (halving A4 pieces of scrap paper that others would throw out). I had taken refuge to $J_1$ precisely _because_ having all of these papers around me felt overwhelming. It was _too_ unstructured, you could say.

As I returned to university and developed an appreciation for the nonlinearity of learning, I began to use A5 papers for more and more, until I felt that I was being unloyal to $J_4$. This lead to a lot of turmoil between me and my journals, and we had to reflect together to come to an agreement to make sure $J_4$ felt cared for.

As time went by, we realised that multisystematism actually gives me more power. Here are some examples:

### `Ephemerals`
Our initial solution was to name anything but $J_4$ an _ephemeral_, owing to the fact that they were not to last. Each ephemeral would have the same final form: crumpled and in the bin. It was only a matter of time. Useful information from each ephemeral would be stored in the journal instead.

However, this was very painful. Each ephemeral would typically contain disparate pieces of information which felt odd to write together. Moreover, sometimes the information would be valuable, but the journal had moved on from the correct chronological position I'd want to put it in. Also, rewriting often formalised the notetaking, which made the journal feel impersonal and robotic. It was all a headache.

### `Auxiliaries`
It started with the _timetable_ ephemeral, which, despite its name, kept itself firmly in the pouch of my journal. It was too useful to throw away. Surely $J_4$ would understand? A short consultation later, and these special forms of ephemerals that served structural functions were elevated with the title of _auxiliaries_ instead. They would serve as the royal guards of the diblian kingdom, protecting it from chaos. Notable auxiliaries include:

- The timetable auxiliary (ofc)
- The daily auxiliary (helping with prioritisation, quicknotes, and decision-making)
- The metadata auxiliary (A subset of daily auxiliaries with further focus on a _specific_ task)
- The tasklist auxiliary (just a giant blurt of tasks and future events)
- The unit content auxiliary (an overview of each of my units and their weekly content and deadlines)

These papers naturally take a configuration during study, almost like a cook's workspace:

1. clean paper on the right
2. actively being used papers in the center
3. auxiliaries on the top lef
4. ephemerals on the bottom left

of my computer.

### `Wallnotes`
Small notes stuck on the wall that each represent something emotionally significant to me: perhaps a learning that I want to put to practice (e.g. how I treat others, how I deal with internal turmoil etc), or a vision I have for the future, or an accomplishment I want to celebrate (e.g. finishing an application, organising an event etc). These wall notes are a great tool for cheering me up and making sure I'm in a good mood.

### `Next steps: Thoughtvaults, Digital Gardens, and GitHub`
As I have continued my reflective practice, I'm finding myself reflecting more deeply on issues I face, and coming up with more well-formulated reflections from my experiences. I wanted to practice sharing my ideas in a computer-written presentation format... for a few reasons:

- I find these ideas beautiful
- I fear to lose them
- I want to be able to trace back why I act the way I do: what learnings have shaped me
- I fear that I wouldn't be able to explain how I got to where I am, good or bad, which would make my life unworthy. At least if I have a digestible account for future generations, they can make something of my experiences
- If I also track my career learnings in this way, I might be able to bypass the expert paradox a little, because what I found difficult I have written down and I can remember the assumptions newbies make
- I want to have my data retrievable by a computer, allowing me to someday use my own data to do statistical research on myself (e.g. cluster pages via similarity, track these alongside time... maybe even create cool graphs showing my areas of thought at any particular point in time. That'd be some cool stuff ngl.)

I initially attempted to write reflections monthly in a 'newsletter/blog' format on my desktop (what I'll call 'the diblian magazine'). This proved to require a lot of effort and sullied the LAW OF LOGGING, so I stopped doing it.

I've learnt a lot more about the capabilities of Git and GitHub. Everytime I learn more, I fall more and more in love with it. Version control seemed like the best way to track these changes over time.

One step towards reaching my goal was to track the system I'm using to make decisions, hence why this repo exists. \*thoughtvault is where my current system is explained and tracked. The name references referencing (i.e. pointers) in C... because I'm quirky like that.

Another step may be to come back to the concept of digital gardens and PKM software that links concepts. This is an area of research for me as I try to see how I can integrate them within my system _comfortably_ without overstepping the LAW OF LOGGING.
