Hey!
I'm Adib Rohani (he/him)

## Studying a Bachelor's in comp sci, majoring in AI

_I'm so pumped this year and I can't even cohesively explain why. Everything is interesting again._

- **CURRENTLY LEARNING** Agile web development, statistical modelling, OOP (in java), data structures and algorithms (in python).
- **PERSONAL CURIOSITY** Trying to learn how to develop a notetaking system that is actually useful and long-lasting.
- **ALSO** Trying to figure out how github works more closely now that I'm developing a project for Agile web dev.
